    <h1 class="aa">TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p class="ab">The metaverse is a proposed expansion to existing internet technologies. Access points for the metaverse include general-purpose computers and smartphones, in addition to augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, virtual reality (VR), and virtual world technologies.
    </p>
    <p class="ac">There are significant business and commercial interests in metaverse-related research and technology. Facebook bought VR company Oculus in 2014, looking to build a new 3-D social space with "connective tissue" to bridge the gap between varying services.
    </p>
   <p class="ad">
    A virtual environment is considered to be the most likely access point to the metaverse. The metaverse's dependency on VR technology places limitations on its development and wide-scale adoption. Limitations stemming from the balance between cost and design include the lack of high quality graphics and a lack of mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets lack image quality, which is optimized for bulky, wired VR goggle systems. Another issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is the cost, with the HTC Vive Pro 2 headset costing US$799 plus controllers in 2021. Many high-end computers are incapable of powering VR machines. In 2016, NVIDIA estimated that 99% of computers on the market were incapable of handling the software requirements for an adequate virtual reality experience.

    <p class="ae"> More sophisticated sensors than are currently available are needed to make AR and VR movements more precise and visual overlays more accurate with higher image quality; visual anchoring, movement tracking, and motion following all need to be handled at scale in order to support these improvements. The widespread adoption of VR largely hinges on sophisticated sensors with the ability to reliably measure depth while consuming little amounts of battery power, all in a portable and affordable model, which has not yet been efficiently produced at a large scale. </p>
    <p class="af">In 2021, the South Korean government announced the creation of a national metaverse alliance with the goal to build a unified national VR and AR platform.

    <h2 class="ag">Technical standards</h2>
    <p class="ah">Common standards, interfaces, and communication protocols among virtual environments are in development. Collaborations and working groups are attempting to create standards and protocols to support interoperability between virtual environments, including:</p>
   <div class="ai">
    <ul>
        <li>OpenXR, application programming interfaces (APIs) for interfacing with VR and AR devices, Khronos Group (2019–present) </li>
        <li>Virtual Worlds—Standard for Systems Virtual Components Working Group (P1828),IEEE (2010–Present)</li>
        <li>Information technology—Media context and control—Part 4: Virtual world object characteristics (ISO/IEC 23005-4:2011),[36] ISO (2008–Present) </li>
        <li>Immersive Education Technology Group (IETG), Media Grid (2008–Present) </li>
        <li>Virtual World Region Agent Protocol (VWRAP),] IETF (2009–2011)</li>
        <li>Metaverse Roadmap, Acceleration Studies Foundation (2006–2007) </li>
        <li>The Open Source Metaverse Project (2004–2008)</li>
        <li>X3D, the successor to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) as the open standard for interactive real-time 3D (web3D). X3D is an accepted standard for integrating virtual and augmented realities with the web.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="aj">Ready Player One</h3>
    <p class="ak">Ready Player One is a 2011 dystopian science fiction novel by Ernest Cline, depicting the world in the year 2045 as being gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for people is a metaverse called the OASIS, which is accessed with a VR headset and wired gloves. It functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual society. A film adaptation was released in 2018</p>
