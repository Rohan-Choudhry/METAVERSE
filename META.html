<h1 class="h">BUILDING THE METAVERSE</h1>
<p class="pa">Weâ€™re already developing exciting new technologies that will help people connect and explore in the metaverse.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2 class="ha">A future made by all of us</h2>
<p class="pb">The metaverse will be a collective project that goes beyond a single company. It will be created by people all over the world, and open to everyone.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="hb">METAVERSE</h3>
<div class="pc">
<p>The metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets. Metaverses, in some limited form, are already present on platforms like VRChat or video games like Second Life.</p>
<p>Current metaverse ambitions are centered on addressing technological limitations with modern virtual and augmented reality devices, as well as expanding the use of metaverse spaces to business, education, and retail applications. Numerous entertainment and social media companies have invested in metaverse-related research and development.
</p>
<p>The metaverse has come to be criticised as a method of public relations building using a purely speculative, "over-hyped" concept based on existing technology. Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from current challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>

<br><br>
<h3 class="hc">Elements</h3>
<p class="pd">The metaverse is described as a means of manufacturing immersive digital spaces for a range of human activity. To achieve this, some iterations of the metaverse involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies.Additional qualities include digital persistence and synchronicity in order to better establish a sense of presence in a realistic environment, along with implementing existing social media elements such as avatar identity, content creation, and social acceptability.</p>
<br><br>
<h4 class="hd">Current implementations</h4>
<h5 class="he">Video games</h5>
<p class="pe">Several components of metaverse technologies have already been developed within modern internet-enabled video games.] The 2003 video game Second Life is often described as the first metaverse,] as it incorporated many aspects of social media into a persistent virtual world. Social functions are often an integral feature in many massively multiplayer online games. Technology journalist Clive Thompson has argued that the emergent, social-based gameplay of Minecraft represents an advanced implementation of the metaverse. Other claims of developing a metaverse have been made for the games Active Worlds, Roblox, Decentraland, and Fortnite] in addition to a few early MUD games.</p>
<br><br>
<h6 class="hf">Virtual reality</h6>
<p class="pf">Metaverse development has often focused on bettering virtual reality technologies due to benefits in establishing immersion in virtual environments. In 2019, the social network company Facebook launched a social VR world called Facebook Horizon. Facebook would later be renamed "Meta Platforms" in 2021. Its chairman Mark Zuckerberg] declared a company commitment to developing a metaverse ecosystem. Much of the underlying virtual reality technology that Meta Platforms advertised remains to be developed. Microsoft acquired the VR company AltspaceVR in 2017, and is planning on integrating metaverse features into Microsoft Teams.</p>
